# 📘 Hands-on Session: Dataset Analysis & Visualization

This repository contains hands-on tasks focused on exploring datasets using Python. Each task is grounded in a real-world problem statement, requiring a combination of **data cleaning**, **statistical analysis**, **visualization**, and **machine learning** techniques.

---

## 🧭 Workflow Overview

1. **Understand the Problem Statement**
2. **Explore the Dataset**
3. **Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**
4. **Apply Statistical and ML Techniques**
5. **Visualize and Interpret the Results**
6. **Document Insights and Observations**

We will use the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`, `pandas` – Data processing
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly` – Data visualization
- `sklearn` – Machine learning
- `NLTK`, `spaCy` – Natural language processing

## 📂 Dataset 1: Leaf Classification

### 🧪 Problem Statement

Investigate the structural features of leaves to understand relationships and predictive power among species.

### 🔍 Questions to Solve

1. Are the properties of leaves (like length, width, curvature, etc.) consistent across leaf types?
2. How many examples do we have for each plant species?
3. Given the length of a leaf and its species, **predict the width** using regression modeling.

### 🧰 Approach

- Load and inspect the dataset
- Visualize features using histograms and scatter plots
- Use `groupby` to count species
- Build a regression model (`LinearRegression`, `RandomForestRegressor`) to predict leaf width from given features

## 📂 Dataset 2: Survey Dataset (Distance vs Time)

### 🧪 Problem Statement

Analyze survey data to clean inconsistencies and build a regression model between distance traveled and time taken.

### 🔍 Questions to Solve

1. Perform data cleaning:
   - Identify missing values and incorrect entries
   - Handle truncations and data-type mismatches
   - Apply imputation for missing values
2. Detect and treat outliers:
   - Use **boxplots** for visual inspection
   - Apply statistical methods (IQR or Z-score)
3. Build a regression model to predict **distance from time**

### 🧰 Approach

- Visualize data distributions
- Use `boxplot` from `seaborn` to detect outliers
- Fit a `LinearRegression` model with time as input and distance as output
- Evaluate with `MAE`, `MSE`, `R² Score`

## 📂 Dataset 3: Text Dataset (NLP Tasks)

### 🧪 Problem Statement

Work with raw text to extract semantic meaning, group similar texts, and classify content.

### 🔍 Questions to Solve

1. Cluster similar text data into groups
2. Generate extractive summaries of long texts
3. Classify text using keyword frequency (TF-IDF or CountVectorizer)
4. Generate a word cloud for high-frequency terms

### 🧰 Approach

- Use `spaCy` for tokenization and named entity recognition
- Use `NLTK` for stopword removal and preprocessing
- Perform KMeans clustering or LDA topic modeling
- Apply basic classification models (`MultinomialNB`, `LogisticRegression`)
- Visualize results using `wordcloud`, bar charts, and t-SNE projections
